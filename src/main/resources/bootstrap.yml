# This 'name' of our application is important
# as the config server typically has to serve up properties for many applictions:
spring:
  application:
    name: lab-3-client					# What set of properties will we ask the config server for?

  cloud:
    config:
      uri: http://localhost:8001		# Where should we call the config server at?
      fail-fast: false # be setting to false the client try ro get the value of config parameters from its local file if the server is down

server:
  port: 8002							# What port should we expose for our web interface


  # Uncomment these lines to activate "northamerica" as the active profile.
  # Ordinarily we would not activate a profile from within a property file, but this is just a demo:
